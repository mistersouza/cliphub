### Color Scheme

‚ñ∑ In the initial design phase, we're rocking a grayscale palette to highlight content structure and nail that user experience. Once we've aced the UX research, we're bringing in accent colors to jazz up the design and make user interaction smoother.

## Deployment

### GitPod

‚ñ∑ Getting your app ready

- Fire up a terminal window and navigate to the root directory.
    - Integrate WhiteNoise to seamlessly serve static files for your React app and Django Admin on deployment
         ```bash
        $ pip3 install whitenoise==6.4.0
        ```
    - Craft a fresh `staticfiles` folder in the root directory
        ```bash
        $ mkdir staticfiles
        ```
- Open up your settings.py file 
    - Setup databse
        ```python
        import dj_database_url

        DATABASES = {
            'default': dj_database_url.parse("<your Postrgres database URL>")
        }
        ```
    - Update settings.py in your Django app
        ```python
        DEBUG = False
        ```
    - Update Allowed Hosts
        ```python
        ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']
    - In `INSTALLED_APPS`, slide `cloudinary_storage` beneath `django.contrib.staticfiles` to let WhiteNoise take charge of your static files.
        ```python
            INSTALLED_APPS = [
                ... # Other apps
                'django.contrib.staticfiles',
                'cloudinary_storage',
                'cloudinary',
                ... # And more apps
            ]
        ```
    - In the `MIDDLEWARE` list, slot WhiteNoise in just below `SecurityMiddleware` and right above `SessionMiddleware`.
        ```python
            MIDDLEWARE = [
            'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware', 
            'corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware',
            'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware',
            ... # Other middlewares
            ]
        ```
    - In the `TEMPLATES` list, tweak the `DIRS` key to point Django and WhiteNoise to your React `index.html` during deployment:
        ```python
            TEMPLATES = [
                {
                    'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
                    'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles', 'build')], # üîç Check this out!
                    'APP_DIRS': True,
                    'OPTIONS': {
                        'context_processors': [
                            'django.template.context_processors.debug',
                            'django.template.context_processors.request',
                            'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',
                            'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',
                        ],
                    },
                },
            ]
        ```
    - In the static files section, define `STATIC_ROOT` and `WHITENOISE_ROOT` to direct Django and WhiteNoise to your admin and React static files for deployment.
        ```python
        STATIC_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'staticfiles'
        WHITENOISE_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'staticfiles' / 'build'
        ```
- Back on the CL
    - Create a requirements. This file tells Heroku what your app needs to run smoothly.
        ```bash
        $ pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
        ```
    - Craft a Procfile. This tells Heroku how to run your app. Think of it as the main instruction manual.
        ```bash
        $ echo web: python app.py > Procfile
        ```
    - Shift models to remote DB.
        ```bash
        $ python3 manage.py migrate
        ```
- The React front end will serve from the domain's root URL, so let's make sure it takes precedence over the DRF interface. 

    - In the **project's urls.py** get rid of `path('', root_route)` 
    ```python
    urlpatterns = [
        path('', root_route), # ‚ùå Later üêä
        path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
        ... # Lots other paths follow
    ]
    ```
    - Import `TempleteView` from `django.views.generic `
    ```python
    from django.contrib import admin
    from django.urls import path, include
    from django.views.generic import TemplateView # üåü Bring it in!
    from .views import logout_route, root_route
    ```
    - Switch it up with this line: `path('', TemplateView.as_view(template_name='index.html'))` üöÄ
    ```python
    urlpatterns = [
        path('', TemplateView.as_view(template_name='index.html')),
        path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
        ... # Lots other paths follow
    ]
    ```
    - Prefix api/ to all the API URLs, except for the home page and admin panel paths! üöÄ And don‚Äôt miss this key line: `handler404 = TemplateView.as_view(template_name='index.html')`‚Äîbe sure to add it at the bottom! üîë And your setup should look pretty much like this:
    ```python
    from django.contrib import admin
    from django.urls import path, include
    from django.views.generic import TemplateView
    from .views import logout_route, root_route

    urlpatterns = [
        path('', TemplateView.as_view(template_name='index.html')), 
        path('admin/', admin.site.urls), 
        path('api/api-auth/', include('rest_framework.urls')), 
        path('api/dj-rest-auth/logout/', logout_route), # Logout route gotta match up first‚ùóÔ∏è
        path('api/dj-rest-auth/', include('dj_rest_auth.urls')), 
        path('api/dj-rest-auth/registration/', include('dj_rest_auth.registration.urls')),
        path('api/', include('clips.urls')),
        path('api/', include('comments.urls')),
        path('api/', include('flags.urls')),
        path('api/', include('followers.urls')),
        path('api/', include('likes.urls')),
        path('api/', include('profiles.urls')),
    ]


    handler404 = TemplateView.as_view(template_name='index.html')

- Last up. On the react app load ` Open the axiosDefaults.js` file on your VS code, set `axios.defaults.baseURL` to `/api`. 
    
    ```javascript
    import axios from 'axios';

    axios.defaults.baseURL = '/api'; // Set the base URL to API heaven üòá
    axios.defaults.headers.post['Content-Type'] = 'multipart/form-data';
    axios.defaults.withCredentials = true;

    export const axiosRequest = axios.create();
    export const axiosResponse = axios.create();
    ```
- Now that we've set up static file collection, let's bundle all static files from Django admin and React into the staticfiles folder for deployment. üöÄ Fire up your CL in the Django project directory, and go on typing 
    ```bash
    $ python3 manage.py collectstatic
    ```
- Next, let's build the React app and transfer the files to the `staticfiles` folder. üöÄ Open a new terminal and `cd` into the frontend directory, and run 
    ```bash
    $ npm run build && mv build ../staticfiles/.
    ```
- You gotta rerun this command every time you deploy changes to your static files, including React code ‚ú® But to replace the old files, just keep running the following command üîÑ
    ```bash
    $ npm run build && rm -rf ../staticfiles/build && mv build ../staticfiles/.
    ```
- Still in you dango project's root directory, make sure Heroku uses the right Python version for your project! üöÄ 
    ```bash
    $ echo "python-3.9.16" > runtime.txt
    ```
‚ñ∑ The site first brewed up in GitPod and then landed in this remote [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mistersouza/cliphub.git).

- And let's talk GIT ‚Äì the commands that made the magic real.
    ```bash
    git status # üëÄ Peek at changes or new stuff ‚Äî your project‚Äôs mood board.
    ```
    ```bash
    git add --all # üéØ Get everything prepped ‚Äî stage files for the big commit.
    ```
    ```bash
    git commit -m " " # ‚úÖ Seal of approval ‚Äî commit the changes.
    ```
    ```bash
    git push # üöÄ Grand finale ‚Äî send it all to GitHub‚Äôs master branch. Boom!
    ```
### Heroku 

‚ñ∑ After all that hustle, it's time to set this project free in the wild, wild web world. Let it spread its wings and conquer the digital realm! 

- Started fresh on Heroku and gave our app a European vibe.
- Swiped right for GitHub as our deployment wingman.
- Dropped in some super-secret config vars for that behind-the-scenes magic. Check out the cool settings
![Config Vars](https://github.com/mistersouza/localle/blob/main/static/assets/images/localle_heroku-vars.png)
- Finally hit that deploy button and let the awesomeness unfold

## Big Ups

‚ñ∑ Sure, I've been the lone wolf, architecting this whole thing‚Äîplanning, designing, and coding away. But truth be told, I owe a lot to the squad that's had my back. And you know what? I wouldn't have it any other way. The teamwork vibe in coding is what makes this journey epic, and I'm all about embracing that collaborative spirit. Cheers to coding camaraderie!
