### Color Scheme

## Deployment

### GitPod

‚ñ∑ Getting your app ready

- Open up your settings.py file 
    - Setup databse
        ```python
        import dj_database_url

        DATABASES = {
            'default': dj_database_url.parse("<your Postrgres database URL>")
        }
        ```
    - Update settings.py in your Django app
        ```python
        DEBUG = False
        ```
    - Update Allowed Hosts
        ```python
        ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']
        ```

- On the CL
    - Create a requirements. This file tells Heroku what your app needs to run smoothly.
        ```bash
        pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
        ```
    - Craft a Procfile. This tells Heroku how to run your app. Think of it as the main instruction manual.
        ```bash
        echo web: python app.py > Procfile
        ```
    - Shift models to ElephantSQL.
        ```bash
        python3 manage.py makemigrations
        python3 manage.py migrate
        ```

‚ñ∑ The site first brewed up in GitPod and then landed in this remote [GitHub repository]().And let's talk GIT ‚Äì the commands that made the magic real.

- **git status** >> It's like peeking into the project's mood board - shows any changes or new stuff.
- **git add --all** >> The "get ready to party" move - stages files for the big commit.
- **git commit -m " "** >> The official seal of approval - commits all the files.
- **git push** >> The grand finale - sends everything to the master branch up there on GitHub. Boom!

### Heroku 

‚ñ∑ After all that hustle, it's time to set this project free in the wild, wild web world. Let it spread its wings and conquer the digital realm! 

- Started fresh on Heroku and gave our app a European vibe.
- Swiped right for GitHub as our deployment wingman.
- Dropped in some super-secret config vars for that behind-the-scenes magic. Check out the cool settings
![Config Vars](https://github.com/mistersouza/localle/blob/main/static/assets/images/localle_heroku-vars.png)

## Big Ups
